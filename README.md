Simple Assignment for Git and GitHub Classroom
==============================================

# Prerequisites
By now, you should be familiar with [**Git**](https://git-scm.com).

# Assignment
We have prepared a very rudimental server that receives via a [YARP](http://www.yarp.it/index.html) port an integer, computes if the integer is **even** or **odd** as well as **prime** or **composite** and then provides back the response.

We are not interested here in how YARP plumbing works but rather we want you to fix the present code using Git and GitHub.

Therefore, you are simply required to **fill in the missing gaps** highlighted by the comment `// FILL IN THE CODE` within the file [**`src/main.cpp`**](./src/main.cpp) and [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) your solution to this repository.

You can test your code [running the script **test.sh**](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv-school.github.io/blob/master/instructions/how-to-run-smoke-tests.md) in the **smoke-test** directory.
